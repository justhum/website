We&#8217;ve named 1.2 after the Bad Bad Hats&#8217; release <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rdio.com\/artist\/Bad_Bad_Hats\/album\/It_Hurts\/\">&#8220;It Hurts&#8221;<\/a>. It&#8217;s such a great EP, and you all need to listen to it right now. A few months back we shot a <a href=\"\/\/justhum.com\/linernotes\/\">Liner Notes<\/a> with them. We&#8217;ll get that cut together and posted soon!<\/p>\n<p>With the release of iOS8 and the bigger iPhone 6 and 6+, we had to change a lot under the hood with Hum&#8217;s layout. These changes allowed us to revisit our song view and add some better navigation within it. <\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_296\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-296\" src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/song.gif\" alt=\"Song\" width=\"320\" class=\"size-full wp-image-296\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-296\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Song View Changes<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Instead of three little dots, we&#8217;ve given each section a tappable icon and moved it into the navigation bar. Like always, your title is the first line of the lyrics, but now we bold the text automatically to make it a little more clear. We just love that we don&#8217;t have a separate field for &#8216;title&#8217;. Just write. Hum will help title and keep you organized.<\/p>\n<p>With all the layout changes, we get landscape orientation for free. We&#8217;ve also allowed for you to use your phone upside down, in case you want to point your phone&#8217;s mic at your bassist, for example.<\/p>\n<p>Many of Hum&#8217;s users are in dim clubs, green rooms, and other places with less-than-ideal lighting. We&#8217;ve increased the contrast throughout Hum, picking a thicker version of our typeface, and making sure highlighted states are darker.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_297\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-297\" src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/sorting.gif\" alt=\"Sorting\" width=\"320\" class=\"size-full wp-image-297\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-297\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sorting Changes<\/p><\/div>\n<p>We&#8217;ve squashed all sorts of bugs as well. For our central european users, some characters were showing up pretty garbled in their lyrics. That got fixed, and so did a lot of little crashers. Our inline player is a little more robust too.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_295\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-295\" src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/library.gif\" alt=\"Library\" width=\"320\" class=\"size-full wp-image-295\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-295\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Library<\/p><\/div>\n<p>As with any major release, there might be some rough edges that we didn&#8217;t catch. If you have any troubles, use Hum to send some feedback in your Settings screen.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, one more thing. We now support dynamic text. If you change the size of the text on your device, Hum will now honor that type size. Sweet!<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_300\" style=\"width: 330px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-300\" src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/dynamic-type.jpg\" alt=\"One of the larger type sizes available on iOS.\" width=\"320\" class=\"size-full wp-image-300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/dynamic-type.jpg 640w, https:\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/10\/dynamic-type-169x300.jpg 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-300\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">One of the larger type sizes available on iOS.<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Enjoy! <a href=\"\/\/justhum.com\/appstore\/\">Download Hum on the App Store<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;ve got a big update for you all.
