I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve had as good a first listen as I have with this record in a very long time. J Roddy straddles the line between Jerry Lee Lewis piano rock n&#8217; roll, and Zeppelin inspired riffage, but puts it all together in a cohesive record. This was played pretty incessantly while making this latest round of features.<\/p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s new?<\/h3>\n<p>As always, head over to the <a href=\"\/\/justhum.com\/releases\/\">release notes<\/a> page for the nitty gritty.<\/p>\n<h3>Searching<\/h3>\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve all got bigger libraries, we&#8217;ve added searching.

We&#8217;ve also customized our typeface to allow for true musical sharp symbols. On top of that, we fixed a lot of under-the-hood stuff in preparation for our Dropbox syncing release.
