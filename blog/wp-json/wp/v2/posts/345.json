A bunch of you have been asking for major \/ minor tonality, and now you&#8217;ve got it. All the Hums in your library will now display &#8216;maj&#8217; or &#8216;min&#8217; next to the key, if you&#8217;ve added one. You&#8217;ll find those buttons next to a newly-redesigned keys\u00a0view.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also notice you can now add arbitrary color-coding to your Hums. This&#8217;ll help you keep track of things now that your libraries are all getting a little bigger. For example, you might want to add a blue color to all your solo songs, or red to your band&#8217;s songs. Or maybe you&#8217;d like to add orange to all your finished songs. That kind of thing. Of course, you&#8217;ll be able to sort by those colors too, so you can easily group them together\u2014and audition them. Or actually finish them!<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-353\" src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/song.png\" alt=\"Song\" width=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/song.png 1350w, https:\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/song-300x72.png 300w, https:\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/03\/song-1024x244.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1350px) 100vw, 1350px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>One last thing: You can also pin songs to the top of your libraries.
