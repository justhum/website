Growing pains! This release will automatically send us usage statistics to help us figure out where some of them are. If you&#8217;d like to opt out tap the settings button at the lower right of your library and flip the &#8220;Usage Statistics&#8221; switch. We&#8217;ll be collecting anonymous data like how many Hums y&#8217;all are recording. How often you use the app. How long your average song is, stuff like that. Again, you can turn it off in two taps.<\/p>\n<p>You can also kill the recording countdown if that was bugging you. Personally, I&#8217;ve always needed about 4 seconds to get situated, to set my phone on my knee, get my dogs to stop barking, etc. If you don&#8217;t need it, flip the switch.<\/p>\n<p>You can also prefer sharps or flats now when specifying keys and tunings. We originally included a nice natural mix. I prefer calling certain notes C# but also refer to others as Bb. Now you can prefer either.<\/p>\n<p>If you get stuck we&#8217;ve added a help section. You can call (for real, it&#8217;s just my phone number), email, or tweet at us. If you&#8217;re ever having a problem we want to hear about it. It&#8217;s the only way we can improve Hum.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also added a translation in Portuguese. If something doesn&#8217;t look right there let us know. Same goes for our Swedish translation.<\/p>\n<p>As always, have a look at the detailed <a href=\"http:\/\/justhum.com\/releases\/\" title=\"Release Notes\">release notes<\/a>. We&#8217;ll keep chasing those crashers and getting Hum to be as stable as possible. Look for a 1.0.5 very soon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We&#8217;ve released another update to Hum.
