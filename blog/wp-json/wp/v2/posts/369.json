We\u2019re really excited to release version 1.6 of Hum. This is largely under-the-hood stuff, but I assure you we\u2019re working on some new much-needed features.<\/p>\n<p>In order start that work, we had to first get our house in order. 1.6 represents a large rewrite of Hum\u2019s codebase. It brings us up to date for iOS 9.\u00a0With true iOS 9 support, we\u2019ve also\u00a0dropped iOS 7.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve improved bluetooth audio playback. We\u2019re now supporting 3D touch.\u00a0Our tuner is also\u00a0bundled in Hum. New users will have it included in their purchase of Hum. Sweet!<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve <a href=\"\/releases\/\">fixed lots of little bugs<\/a> in the meantime.<\/p>\n<h3>Our roadmap<\/h3>\n<p>Now that Hum has a more stable foundation, we can <em>finally<\/em> start building some more features for y\u2019all. In no particular order, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been working on besides the rewrite:<\/p>\n<h3>Multiple recordings<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/multiple-recordings.png\" alt=\"Multiple Recordings\" width=\"675\" \/><br \/>\n<img src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/subsequent-record.png\" alt=\"Multiple Recordings\" width=\"675\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Like most of you, I\u00a0want to be able to store every version of a Hum\u2019s audio within a Hum, from that first sketch to a full band demo. We think we\u2019ve come up with a pretty slick way of having multiple recordings per Hum.<\/p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve added a single recording, you&#8217;ll be able to swipe to add a new one. It\u2019ll show your newest one first, but if you\u2019d like, you can swipe back in time on the player to view other versions.<\/p>\n<h3>Trimming<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/trimming.png\" alt=\"Trimming\" width=\"675\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Duh! Let\u2019s make sure folks are able to trim the fat on their recordings. Our countdown alleviates some of the issues, but let&#8217;s make sure we\u2019re able to cut out some of the awkward silence or audio of the band noodling before capturing a performance.<\/p>\n<h3>Folders + Trash<\/h3>\n<p><img src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/folders.png\" alt=\"Folders\" width=\"675\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve laid a lot of the groundwork for a larger redesign of Hum that\u2019ll support folders. If you press and hold on a Hum in your library, it\u2019ll pop open a view where you can manage which folders each Hum belongs to. With folders, you\u2019ll be able to keep things organized by band or project. Lots of folks have been asking for this, and we\u2019re excited to be working on it!<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/03\/editing.png\" alt=\"Edit folders\" width=\"675\" \/><\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll be introducing the trash as well so you won\u2019t have to worry about accidentally deleting a Hum.<\/p>\n<h3>Thanks!<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019re elated\u00a0that Hum is so central to your songwriting process. These improvements over the next year should make Hum even better.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Howdy! We\u2019re really excited to release version 1.6 of Hum.
