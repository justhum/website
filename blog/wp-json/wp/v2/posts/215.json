We added a few little usability improvements that really add up. On top of that, we fixed a bunch of little bugs that you can always find detailed on our <a href=\"\/releases\/\">releases<\/a> page.<\/p>\n<p>We got rid of the confirm \/ dismiss screen every time you record something. Now it just accepts the recording automatically. Our initial assumption was that if you blew a chord, it&#8217;d get you into a new recording quicker. We ended up creating a barrier to capturing ideas by doing so, so we stripped it. We&#8217;d rather any friction in our app to be during deletion, not creation.<\/p>\n<p>Sliders now have tick marks that allow you to be a little more precise. It gives you some context for sliding. This control is something we&#8217;d like to open source, so keep your eyes open for something like that after we add our Dropbox support.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_216\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/http:\/\/dribbble.com\/shots\/1424689-Ticks-React\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-216\" class=\"size-full wp-image-216\" alt=\"Slider Ticks\" src=\"\/\/justhum.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/ticks_react.gif\" width=\"400\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-216\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Looks good, right?<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http:\/\/petersteinberger.com\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Steinberger<\/a> and his wonderful <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/steipete\/PSPDFTextView\" target=\"_blank\">PSPDFTextView<\/a> library, we&#8217;ve improved our Lyrics &amp; Notes fields. Your text cursor will no longer be hidden underneath the keyboard if you&#8217;re at the last line of your lyrics or notes.<\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll also notice that the lyrics field is now called &#8220;Title &amp; Lyrics&#8221;. A surprising (to us, anyway) amount of users weren&#8217;t discovering that the first line you typed in the lyrics field became the title of your Hum. Again, in regards to friction, we don&#8217;t want to have to show any dialogs like &#8220;Give your Hum a title&#8221;. It&#8217;d only get in the way of capturing an idea. We really think this is the best way to title something. Just write. Hopefully this will help our users discover that.<\/p>\n<p>Oh, and to all our Swedish users, who we were shocked were so many, we&#8217;ve added a translation for you. If you&#8217;re a multilingual musician and want to help translate Hum, please email me!<\/p>\n<p>For all those users that are running iOS7.1 betas, pay close attention to these updates. We don&#8217;t officially support beta operating systems, but have a gander. Some annoyances should now be fixed for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As far as minor updates goes, this one is pretty significant.
