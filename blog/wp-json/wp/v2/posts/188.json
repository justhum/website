Help us tell everyone you know whose phone is filled with voice memos that there&#8217;s a better way to keep your riffs organized.

Post about us on Facebook. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/intent\/tweet?text=Hum+will+be+available+Jan.+27th.+It's+an+app+for+songwriting+that's+an+awesome+alternative+to+notes+and+voice+memos.&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fjusthum.com%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Tweet about us<\/a>. Help us tell everyone about Hum. Tell your neighbor who won&#8217;t ever stop playing the guitar, or that guy who plays the flute while walking his dog. Tell hip-hoppers and indie rockers, jazz trios and djent guitarists. Tell &#8217;em all&#8230;please.<\/p>\n<h3>Release Notes<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;re very proud of Version 1.0. We&#8217;ve named it <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rdio.com\/artist\/Calexico\/album\/Algiers\/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Algiers&#8221;<\/a> after Calexico&#8217;s latest effort. Their record was played incessantly during Hum&#8217;s development, and it&#8217;s really great. You can see the progress we took to get here by reading our <a href=\"\/releases\/\">release notes<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Roadmap<\/h3>\n<p>We don&#8217;t want to give away too much of our roadmap. I assure you we have big plans, but we&#8217;d rather delight and surprise when new features land in the app store.<\/p>\n<p>That said, we don&#8217;t ever want you to lose any of your ideas. Ever. We can&#8217;t think of anything more heartbreaking than losing even a single idea.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, our next big feature will be enabling Dropbox syncing. It will be a free update. You&#8217;ll be able to plug in your Dropbox account and Hum will keep your library synced and backed up. That way, if your phone gets stolen or lost, you&#8217;ll always be able to restore your library from your copy on Dropbox.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, we&#8217;d like to tip our hats to our beta testers. You played a big part in making Hum great.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks, everyone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Good news, everyone! Hum has been approved by Apple.
