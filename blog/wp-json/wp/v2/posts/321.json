Obviously, no one would never categorize a song as being &#8220;59 happy&#8221; or even think like that, but that&#8217;s what our control does under the hood.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, we wanted something a little more fuzzy. We wanted users to be able to tell, generally, where their slider value ended up. Simply showing ticks on the slider was a bit noisy, so I whipped up a quick prototype of the ticks appearing only when the slider was touched. We also added the additional affordance of the images changing color as the control approached it. Between the ticks only being shown when they&#8217;re needed, and the additional color affordance, I&#8217;m really proud of our results. Ellen&#8217;s wrapped it up into clean, reusable code.
