                        When viewing a Hum, the lyrics/notes input could crash the app if you opened and closed the keyboard in rapid succession. Not sure why you&rsquo;d be doing that, but we fixed it anyway.

                    <li>
                        <span class="fixed tag">Fixed</span>
                        If you left Hum open for a very long time or forced quit without saving, the song you were working on could have been lost.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span class="fixed tag">Fixed</span>
                        If Hum was put in the background for a long time, sometimes the inline player&rsquo;s waveforms wouldn&rsquo;t show up.
                    </li>
                </ul>
